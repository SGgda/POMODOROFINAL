I have created a simple project - POMODORO timer .
<br>
The Pomodoro Timer project is a productivity tool that helps manage work and break intervals using the Pomodoro Technique. It features a countdown timer that alternates between focused work sessions and short breaks, enhancing concentration and time management. The project can be customized to suit individual preferences for work and break durations.
